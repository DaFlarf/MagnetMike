- How to play

".EXE, Cogito ergo sum" is a Game Boy Compatible game, 
it works as an actual Gameboy Game ROM.

Unzip the Zipped folder and open the .gb file 
using a Game boy emulator. I usually do it by clicking 
and dragging the file onto the emulator.


- GB Studio.

This game was made in GB Studio, an engine that 
is pretty intuitive, but that is still in develpoment.
There will be times that certain ojects/npcs will just 
not render if you walk in "wrong", some texture 
will glitch a bit, rendering pixes where they're 
not supposed to be, things like that.

I believe this version of GB Studio ( V2 beta) i used
to make this game was made for the creation of simpler games,
and i only realized how these bugs affected some playthroughs 
when i was more than halfway done with it, so i've made the 
decision of finishing it in this version and consider remaking
it when GB studio gets better versions.

So I reccomend that you use your emulator's 
save states along with the game's built-in
save system.

I will also consider writing an walkthrough later on.

With that said, GB Studio still made all of this possible, and
even if the engine is not perfect (yet), they deserve credit and
all the support they can get. Go check them out!

-Meet The Family!

- ???(Main Chacter/You)
Main Characteristic: Wavy-Curly Fur.
Pronouns: He/Him.
Profession: Jack of All Trades

Nothing really comes to mind when describing this 
Protogen, except that he took a liking to sleeping. 
You'll be controlling them. 

- FM (Father-Mother?)
Main Characteristic: Snow White fur.
Pronouns: They/Them
Profession: Ship's pilot, Master of All.

They keep the Family together. Fatherly and
Motherly at times, not just to YOU but to
the other integrants as well.
They're considered the Leader.

- BB (BlackBunny)
Main Characteristic: Long Ears.
Pronouns: He/Him
Profession: Information and Communications Technology Guy. 

He's a bit anti-social and have issues with socializing.
Very skilled in the ICT area, and is usually in charge of
maintaining the technology on-board.

-Tommorrow ( Yes, with TWO "M"s)
Main Characteristic: Long Fur.
Pronouns: She/Her
Profession: Herbologist, Gardener, Florist, Flora Expert.

Illiterate, and even if she's quite social, she struggles 
with expressing herself. She's really good with plants though,
to the point she single-handedly supports all the life on the ship
with what she makes in the Green Room.

-MK(M1ke)
Main characteristic: Big Build.
Pronouns: He/Him.
Profession: Mechanic, Heavy-Duty Go-to.

If BB can't fix it, it's probably MK's Responsabilty. He's the one
who usually fixes the propulsors, the Gravity module, Appliances, you name it.
He will Work with BB if there's any Sofware-Hardware integration involved.
Really strong.

- Items and Programs

Link-in Cable: Cable used to connect to a Device's CyberSpace. Cheaper cables
won't support bigger CyberSpaces.

Crowbar: Used to unjam jammed doors. Rudimentary, but efficient.

Remote Controller: Short Reach Radio-wave remote controllers. Activates and 
Deactivates... something?

Level-? License Cards: Gives you permission to access cartain areas.

FireWall Breaker: Hacking Program. Obliterates FireWalls with a hit.

TruthReveal: Hacking Program. By-passes all encryption and shows the user the
true form of the object.

And more!

- The nature of this Manual

The Manual works more as a little extra content as
something useful. Of course, there's a bit of useful information
but it's not really something you NEED to read in order to 
understand the game.

With that said, i've also added maps by the end of it, but they're
not as useful as they look.

-Feedback

If you've completed the Game, your feedback is appreciated!
Please, detail your critiques, point where the problem is, as
otherwise, i'll have a hard time identifying what needs change
and what doesn't.

- Zenith's Outer Reach

This is a Game that focus on a Protogen, an furry species created
by CoolKoinu. Protogen live in ZOR, the main setting for the lore.
As you play through the game, you'll see no mention of ZOR anywhere,
that is, of course, by design, as i cannot dictate if this game is
even canon-compatible, even i wish it was.
It CAN be canon-compatible but that can only be dictated by the ones in 
charge of the lore
