[HM, MF Report n77]

The Ship's MainFrame is bigger than i imagined, 
it's so easy to get lost. I've been writing these
notes here in case i forget how to navigate it.

First of all. Teleport Tiles. They're the ones 
with white beads around it. Stepping on them 
will send me to the Atrium section.

- MF2 NW Maze

It's located in the MainFrames' 2nd floor (MF2),
however, unlike the other mazes, this one
isn't accessible from the second floor at all.
The only ways to get in this Maze is through 
MF3 own NW Maze.
From what i could gather, there's two ladders 
that leads you down in.

- MF3 NW Maze

Sect. B's PowerPlant Avatar is there.
This one pisses me off so so much, there's no
reason for it to be like that.
I usually just go through the nearest teleport,
over and over, until, you know, it sends me out 
of it.

-Sector C

Sector C used to be accessible from the MainFrame,
 until people there just filled the place with more
of these little homes. I blasted one of the houses
in the third floor to make way.
